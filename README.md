tagSENT
=======

tagSENT is short for Tagalog Sentiment Analysis module created by 
Ronald William Amos, Kim Luther Fonte, and Steffi Louise Vinluan 
for their thesis in Don Bosco Technical College. Currently, the
modules are not yet finished so don't be too harsh with our sentiment
analyzer :>

We applied a rule-based approach on our sentiment analysis. We got our prior
sentiment polarity from the SentiWordNet database.
